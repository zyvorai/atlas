# Connecting Hermes Agent to Atlas

[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) is a self-improving AI agent CLI/
gateway by Nous Research. Atlas doesn't bundle it — install it yourself following its own
[quick-install instructions](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent#quick-install). This
page only covers pointing Hermes's MCP client at Atlas's MCP server (`docs/API.md`'s "MCP"
section) so it can use Atlas's inventory/advisor tools during an on-call or ops session.

## 1. Build the gateway with MCP support

MCP support is a default-off Cargo feature:

```bash
cargo build --release -p atlas-gateway --features mcp
# or for local dev:
cargo run -p atlas-gateway --features mcp
```

## 2. Mint a scoped token for Hermes

`POST /auth/tokens` requires an admin token. Mint an **operator**-role token for Hermes to use day
to day — none of the exposed MCP tools need admin, and `ops_advisor` specifically requires operator
or higher:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5110/api/atlas/v1/auth/tokens \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_JWT>" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subject":"hermes-agent","role":"operator","ttl_secs":7776000}'
# 201 → { "token": "<jwt>", "jti": "jti_...", ... }
```

`ttl_secs` above is the 90-day maximum; pick something shorter if this token will live in a config
file you don't want to worry about. Revoke it any time with `POST /auth/tokens/{jti}/revoke`
(`docs/API.md`'s "Token revocation & rate limiting" section) — this doesn't affect any other token.

## 3. Point Hermes at Atlas

Add Atlas as a remote MCP server in Hermes's own config (`~/.hermes/config.yaml`):

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  atlas:
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:5110/api/atlas/v1/mcp"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer <the token from step 2>"
```

For an HTTPS deployment, use the gateway's `ATLAS_HTTPS_ADDR` host/port instead.

## What Hermes can do through this

| Tool | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `list_clusters` | Storage clusters with capacity/health |
| `cluster_health` | Detailed health for one cluster |
| `list_backends` | Registered backends with a capacity/health summary |
| `list_pools` | Storage pools, filterable by backend/kind |
| `list_volumes` | Volumes, filterable by state/backend/kind — scoped to Hermes's own tenant |
| `list_alerts` | Open/resolved alerts from the monitor worker |
| `metrics_summary` | Aggregate capacity across clusters |
| `ops_advisor` | The Ops Advisor's risk score, evidence, and prioritized runbook |

**Every tool here is read-only/advisory.** None of them create, delete, expand, cordon, or
otherwise mutate anything in Atlas — the same `can_execute: false` boundary the Ops Advisor itself
enforces (`docs/AI_ADVISOR.md`). Hermes can *observe* Atlas's state and get advisory analysis
through this connection; acting on that analysis (resizing a volume, cordoning a backend, etc.)
still means using `atlasctl` or the REST API directly, with a human in the loop.
