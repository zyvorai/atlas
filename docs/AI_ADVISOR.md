# Atlas Ops Advisor

Atlas Ops Advisor turns current Atlas telemetry into an explainable risk score and a prioritized,
read-only runbook. The endpoint never executes an action and does not require a model.

Operators can use **Storage Center → Observability → Ops Advisor** to ask a focused question,
choose local/automatic/LLM analysis, inspect evidence, and follow the prioritized runbook.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5110/api/atlas/v1/ai/advisor \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question":"What should the storage team handle first?","mode":"local"}'
```

The response contains:

- a bounded `risk_score` and `risk_level`;
- evidence from capacity, the 14-day forecast, recovery counters, open alerts, and recent failures;
- prioritized actions pointing only to read-only Atlas endpoints;
- `can_execute: false`, an explicit automation safety boundary.

## Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `local` | Deterministic analysis; no operational context leaves Atlas. |
| `auto` | Uses an OpenAI-compatible provider when configured, otherwise local; safely falls back on provider failure. |
| `llm` | Requires a configured provider and returns `503` if it fails. |

Configure an optional provider with `ATLAS_AI_BASE_URL`, `ATLAS_AI_MODEL`, and optionally
`ATLAS_AI_API_KEY` and `ATLAS_AI_TIMEOUT_SECS`. The provider may rewrite only the executive summary;
Atlas computes and retains authority over the score, evidence, and actions. Remote endpoints must
use HTTPS. Plain HTTP is permitted only for a loopback model endpoint.

When authentication is enabled, the endpoint requires an operator-or-higher token and records an
`ai.advisor` audit event. Questions are capped at 512 characters, model output at 2,000 characters,
and only aggregate telemetry plus at most 20 alert titles is sent to the provider.

## Incident correlation

`GET /api/atlas/v1/ai/incidents` groups related open alerts and recent job failures into incident
families: data safety, capacity, Ceph recovery, replication, job engine, availability, or
unclassified. Each incident includes the contributing signals, highest severity, a bounded
correlation-confidence score, a likely-cause explanation, and read-only inspection endpoints.

This is deterministic correlation rather than a claim of statistical causation. It reduces alert
fatigue while keeping every contributing signal visible to the operator.

## What-if capacity planning

`POST /api/atlas/v1/ai/what-if` projects risk without mutating inventory:

```json
{
  "add_capacity_bytes": 1099511627776,
  "horizon_days": 90,
  "projected_growth_bytes_per_day": 10737418240,
  "assume_alerts_resolved": false,
  "assume_recovery_complete": false
}
```

The response compares baseline and projected risk, capacity utilization, days-to-full, remaining
actions, and explicit assumptions. Horizons are limited to 1–365 days, added capacity to 1 EiB,
and growth must be finite and non-negative. The endpoint records an `ai.what_if` audit event and
always returns `can_execute: false`.

## Explainable anomaly detection

`GET /api/atlas/v1/ai/anomalies?minutes=360&sensitivity=3.5` analyzes persisted metric history
without an external model. It detects upward deviations in:

- capacity growth;
- read/write byte deltas;
- read/write operation deltas;
- concurrent jobs;
- open alerts.

The detector uses the median and median absolute deviation (MAD), which are resistant to older
spikes contaminating the baseline. Cumulative counters are converted to per-sample deltas before
analysis. Each result exposes its current value, baseline, MAD, percentage change, anomaly score,
severity, explanation, and a read-only inspection endpoint.

The query accepts a 15-minute to 14-day window and sensitivity from 2–10. Lower sensitivity finds
smaller deviations. Atlas also reports `telemetry_status` (`fresh`, `stale`, or `unavailable`) and
`latest_sample_age_minutes`. Detection is paused with a warning when the latest sample is over
15 minutes old, its timestamp is invalid, or telemetry is unavailable; old spikes are never
presented as current incidents. At least five history samples are required; Atlas returns a warning rather
than inventing a result when the baseline is insufficient.
