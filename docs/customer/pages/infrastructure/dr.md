# Disaster Recovery

## Purpose

Cross-cluster RBD mirroring — peers, mirrors, promote/demote/failover.

## When to use it

- Operate **Disaster Recovery** when your job matches this page
- Prefer **Command Deck** (`/`) if you are unsure where to start
- Confirm gateway auth and that a storage driver is registered if inventories look empty

## How to get there

- Route: `/dr`
- Nav: **INFRASTRUCTURE → Disaster Recovery**

## Operate from the console (UX)

1. Open `/dr` and read peers/mirrors + control-plane/dataplane readiness.
2. Add peer; enable mirroring on images; Promote / Demote / Failover with confirms.
3. Force promote only for split-brain recovery.
4. **Empty / fail:** Dataplane unverified → need second Ceph site; peers=0 → add peer first.
5. **Success:** Mirrors healthy; failover job succeeds when rehearsed.

Use `http://<host>:5110/` for Storage Center (cluster NodePort often `:30511`, HTTPS `:30543`). Health: `GET /health`. Mutations return durable jobs — watch **Jobs**. Never publish lab IPs in customer docs.
