# Backups

## Purpose

Volume backups into object buckets — create, restore, and retire copies.

## When to use it

- Operate **Backups** when your job matches this page
- Prefer **Command Deck** (`/`) if you are unsure where to start
- Confirm gateway auth and that a storage driver is registered if inventories look empty

## How to get there

- Route: `/backups`
- Nav: **DATA PROTECTION → Backups**

## Operate from the console (UX)

1. Open `/backups`.
2. **Backup** — select volume + destination bucket; wait for the job.
3. Restore opens a modal (optional new volume name).
4. Bulk-delete selected backups when retiring.
5. **Empty / fail:** Create a bucket first under Buckets; ensure volume exists.
6. **Success:** Backup row with created time; restore job completes.

Use `http://<host>:5110/` for Storage Center (cluster NodePort often `:30511`, HTTPS `:30543`). Health: `GET /health`. Mutations return durable jobs — watch **Jobs**. Never publish lab IPs in customer docs.
