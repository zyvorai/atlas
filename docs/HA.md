# High availability foundation

Atlas has historically run as a **single replica** with SQLite on a ReadWriteOnce PVC. True
multi-replica HA needs a shared database (PostgreSQL). This document describes what has landed,
what's proven, and what's left for a production multi-replica cutover.

## Status: query layer is backend-agnostic (Phases A + B landed)

Every crate now builds against `sqlx::AnyPool` and connects to either SQLite or Postgres at
runtime, chosen by `ATLAS_DATABASE_URL`'s scheme — there is no more compile-time `postgres`
Cargo feature. Lab/gateway **default to SQLite**; nothing in `deploy/` flips the URL yet, so this
is not a behavior change for existing deployments — it's the query layer becoming capable of
running on Postgres in the same binary.

| Landed | Detail |
|---|---|
| **`migrations-postgres/`** | Postgres dialect of `migrations/`, kept 1:1 in lockstep (`scripts/check-migrations-parity.sh`, wired into CI — fails the build if the two directories' migration numbers ever diverge, which happened silently twice before this check existed). |
| **`atlas_inventory::connect()`/`migrate()`** | One function each, no feature flag. `connect()` uses `sqlx::any::install_default_drivers()` + `AnyPoolOptions`, auto-detecting SQLite vs Postgres from the URL scheme; SQLite-only pragmas (WAL, `foreign_keys`, `busy_timeout`, `synchronous`) apply via an `after_connect` hook, skipped for Postgres. `migrate()` scheme-dispatches to `migrations/` or `migrations-postgres/`. |
| **Query portability cleanup** | All ~250 `sqlx::query` call sites across `atlas-inventory`/`atlas-jobs`/`atlas-monitor`/`atlas-gateway`/`atlas-databridge` (the DataBridge control-plane tables, not customer source-DB connections) use `$N` placeholders (both backends' drivers accept these identically — confirmed live, `sqlx::Any` does zero placeholder rewriting itself). `strftime('now', ...)` (~80 sites) replaced with a Rust-bound `chrono` timestamp via `now_rfc3339()`; `INSERT OR IGNORE` → `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`; SQLite's `COLLATE NOCASE` → `lower(x) = lower($N)` (with a matching expression index in both migration directories); SQLite's 2-argument scalar `MAX(a, b)` (Postgres's `MAX()` is aggregate-only) → `CASE WHEN a > b THEN a ELSE b END`. |
| **State backup** | `spawn_state_backup` branches on backend: SQLite keeps `VACUUM INTO`; Postgres shells out to `pg_dump --format=custom` (mirrors the existing pattern of shelling out to the `ceph`/`rbd` CLI — the gateway image needs `pg_dump` on `PATH` when `ATLAS_DATABASE_URL` is a Postgres URL). |
| **Live-verified against a real Postgres** | `crates/atlas-inventory/tests/postgres_live.rs` (`#[ignore]`, needs `DATABASE_URL`) exercises connect+migrate+schema parity, the job-claim/reclaim/retry state machine in `jobs.rs` (where the `MAX(a,b)` bug was actually found), and `users.rs`'s case-insensitive username lookup — not just that the code compiles against Postgres. Run via `./scripts/smoke-postgres-ha.sh --migrate`. |
| **Helm chart `database.kind`** | `deploy/helm/atlas/values.yaml`'s new `database.kind: sqlite\|postgres` (+ `database.existingSecret`/`secretKey`) switches `templates/deployment.yaml`/`pvc.yaml` between the default single-replica shape (local PVC, `Recreate`) and a Postgres-backed one (`ATLAS_DATABASE_URL` from a Secret, no PVC rendered, `RollingUpdate`, `replicaCount` free to raise). See `deploy/helm/atlas/README.md`'s "Multi-replica (Postgres-backed) deployment". |
| **Dual-backend CI (`postgres-test` job)** | `crates/atlas-gateway/tests/common/mod.rs`'s `fresh_database_url()` makes every existing integration test backend-agnostic: unchanged by default (a throwaway SQLite temp file, same as before), or — when `ATLAS_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set to an admin Postgres connection string — a freshly `CREATE DATABASE`'d Postgres database per test (real per-test isolation, not a shared/schema-scoped DB). `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `postgres-test` job runs the full ~200-test `atlas-gateway` suite a second time against a `postgres:16` service container this way, plus `atlas-inventory`'s `postgres_live.rs` tests. This is what actually found the four bugs below — they were real, previously undiscovered schema/query gaps, not migration-process risk. |
| **Postgres schema bugs found and fixed by the above** | (1) Byte-capacity/size columns (`storage_clusters.*_capacity_bytes`, `storage_pools`/`storage_osds`/`storage_volumes`'s `*_bytes`, `storage_tenant_quotas.max_bytes`, `metrics_history`'s capacity columns, DataBridge's `size_bytes`/`lag_bytes`/`bytes_total`/`bytes_done`) were declared Postgres `INTEGER` (4 bytes, ~2.1GB max) instead of `BIGINT` (8 bytes) — SQLite's `INTEGER` is *always* 8 bytes regardless of the declared name, so this only ever existed on the Postgres side (migration `0032_bigint_capacity_columns.sql`). (2) `SUM(bigint)` returns Postgres `NUMERIC`, which `sqlx::Any` can't decode at all — every `SUM(...)` over a now-`BIGINT` column needed an explicit `CAST(... AS BIGINT)` (`tenants::usage`, `backend_breakdown`, `metrics_summary`). (3) `REAL` columns (`storage_metrics.value`, `metrics_history`'s IO-rate columns, `object_migrations.throughput_mbps`) had the same always-vs-sometimes-8-byte gap as (1) — Postgres `REAL` is 4-byte `float4`, SQLite's is always 8-byte, and the Rust side binds `f64` throughout (migration `0033_double_precision_real_columns.sql`, widening to `DOUBLE PRECISION`). (4) SQLite's JSON1 functions (`json_extract()`, `json_set()`) have no Postgres equivalent whose query *text* is identical on both backends (Postgres's `->>`/`jsonb_set` use a different path syntax entirely) — `set_volume_qos`, `list_policy_drift`, and `protection::policy_targets_by_volume` were rewritten to pull the raw JSON text column and do the read/merge in Rust instead, matching the date-math pattern used everywhere else in this migration. |
| **Cross-replica rate limiting** | Resolves the architectural constraint below (kept for the historical reasoning): `RateLimiter::allow()` (`crates/atlas-gateway/src/state.rs`) stays exactly as synchronous and DB-free as before — still safe to call from the gRPC path's synchronous `tonic::Interceptor` — but is now cluster-aware via a *separate* periodic background task, `spawn_rate_limit_sync` (started from `startup.rs`, `ATLAS_RATE_LIMIT_SYNC_SECS`, default `2`), which writes this replica's own current-window counts to a new `rate_limit_counters` table (migration `0034`, `atlas_inventory::rate_limit`) and reads back each actor's cluster-wide total, flagging anyone already over budget so `allow()` denies them immediately even if this replica's own local count hasn't hit `rpm` yet. `window_minute`/`count` were deliberately kept plain `INTEGER` (not `BIGINT`) since both are guaranteed small — sidesteps the `SUM(bigint)`→`NUMERIC` decode issue above entirely, live-verified on real Postgres rather than just reasoned about. Eventually consistent within one sync interval — a real, documented tradeoff for a governance/abuse-prevention control, not a hard security boundary; harmless on a single SQLite replica (finds only its own counts, confirms what the local check already knew). |

Remaining for a full multi-replica cutover (one Phase C item):

1. `deploy/postgres-lab/` gets a real smoke test beyond connect+migrate (apply migrations, then
   exercise real read/write flows) — lower priority now that CI's `postgres-test` job exercises the
   full query layer against a real Postgres on every push/PR.
2. Ceph CLI/local `/etc/ceph` credentials — **already not blocking**: the real-Ceph Deployment
   renders `/etc/ceph` per-pod via its own `initContainer` (see the Helm chart), so this item from
   an earlier version of this doc no longer applies.

## What is durable now

| Piece | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Job rows** | Every write is a `storage_jobs` row. The in-memory channel is only a wake-up. |
| **DB poller** | `ATLAS_JOB_POLL_SECS` (default `2`) scans for due `queued`/`pending` work and wakes the worker. Survives channel loss and process restarts. |
| **Retry backoff** | `next_attempt_at` is honored by recovery + poller (jobs are not fired early after a crash). |
| **Atomic claim** | `try_claim` stamps `locked_by` / `locked_at` and flips state to `running` so channel + poller races cannot double-execute. Verified on real Postgres, not just SQLite. |
| **Stale reclaim** | `ATLAS_JOB_STALE_SECS` (default `900`) re-queues `running` jobs whose lock is older than the threshold (hard kill without boot recovery). |
| **Boot recovery** | Interrupted `running` → `failed` (fail-safe); due queued work is re-enqueued. |
| **Leader lease** | `leader_lease` table gates monitor / scheduler / DataBridge reconciler so only one holder schedules. Design was already portable (an atomic conditional `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE ... WHERE` upsert) — only needed dialect translation, not a redesign. |

## What still blocks multi-replica

1. **SQLite + RWO PVC on the default install** — the chart still defaults to `database.kind:
   sqlite`. Set `database.kind: postgres` (see `deploy/helm/atlas/README.md`) to lift this — the
   query layer itself is ready (see "Live-verified" above) and the chart now renders
   `RollingUpdate` + no PVC in that mode.

Nothing else on this list — cross-replica rate limiting (see "Cross-replica rate limiting" above)
was the last code-level gap.

## PostgreSQL cutover

Lab Postgres for development (does **not** switch Atlas's own deploy manifests yet):

```bash
deploy/postgres-lab/up.sh   # or: docker compose -f deploy/postgres/docker-compose.yml up -d
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://atlas:<password>@<host>:<port>/atlas
./scripts/smoke-postgres-ha.sh --migrate
```

To actually run the gateway against Postgres locally:

```bash
ATLAS_DATABASE_URL="postgres://atlas:<password>@<host>:<port>/atlas" cargo run -p atlas-gateway
```

`connect()` auto-detects the backend from the URL scheme — no feature flag, no code change.

## Config knobs

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ATLAS_DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite://atlas.db?mode=rwc` | SQLite or Postgres URL — backend auto-detected by `connect()` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | Used by `scripts/smoke-postgres-ha.sh` / the `#[ignore]`d live Postgres tests |
| `ATLAS_JOB_POLL_SECS` | `2` | Durable queue poll interval (`0` disables; tests use `0`) |
| `ATLAS_JOB_STALE_SECS` | `900` | Reclaim stale `running` locks (`0` disables) |
| `ATLAS_STATE_BACKUP_SECS` | `0` (disabled) | Periodic self-state backup interval; snapshot mechanism (`VACUUM INTO` vs `pg_dump`) auto-selected by backend |
| `ATLAS_RATE_LIMIT_RPM` | `0` (disabled) | Per-actor requests/min; `allow()` stays in-process/sync regardless of backend |
| `ATLAS_RATE_LIMIT_SYNC_SECS` | `2` | Cross-replica rate-limit sync interval (`0` disables cross-replica awareness; local-only limiting still applies) |
